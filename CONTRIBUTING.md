## I just have a question!
We have a Discord support server where you can ask your questions. But first, please take a look at the documentation to make sure the answer to your question is not already answered there. If you still need help, when asking your question, please provide as much context as possible (such as steps you've taken, error messages, etc.) which will help answer your question faster.

#### Legal Notice
All commits must be signed with a Signed-off-by line in the commit description matching the commit author. This certifies (under the Developer Certificate of Origin) that you have written the code or have the right to submit the code to the project. Full details can be found at https://developercertificate.org/.

Additionally, most of Tornium is licensed under [AGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html), however different parts of the monorepo/codebase may have different licensing. Be sure to read the `LICENSE` files in the various root directories and the license headers within the respective files.

### Reporting Bugs
#### Before submitting a bug report
A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report such as the following details:

- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How to submit a good bug report
> [!WARNING]
> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities, or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. See the [security policy](SECURITY.md).

We use GitHub Issues and Discord to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:
- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/Tornium/tornium/) on GitHub or create a ticket on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/pPcqTRTRyF).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Include screenshots or videos which show the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own.

Once it's filed:
- The developer will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and will not be addressed until reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

### Suggesting Features/Enhancements
This section guides you through submitting an feature/enhancement suggestion for Tornium, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.
#### Before submitting feature suggestions
- Read the documentation to make sure that the feature is not already supported.
- Perform a search in GitHub and the Discord server to determine if this feature has already been suggested.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It’s up to you to make a strong case to convince the project’s developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset.

#### How to submit a good feature suggestion
- Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues.
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to include screenshots and animated GIFs which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Tornium users.
