        <h3 class="card-title">Tornium Terms of Service</h3>

        <p class="card-subtitle"><b>Last Updated:</b> August 24th, 2025</p>
        <p class="card-text" style="color: white">
            These Terms of Service (”Terms”) describe our commitments to you, and your rights and
            responsibilities when using our Services. Please read them carefully and reach out to us if
            you have any questions. <b>If you don’t agree to these Terms, don’t use our Services.</b>
        </p>

        <p class="card-text" style="color: white">
            If you access or use the Service, you agree to and are bound to the below terms and all
            applicable laws and regulations. You are also responsible for informing users in your
            Discord server(s) about these Terms. There may be times where we do not exercise or
            enforce a right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not mean we are waiving
            that right or provision. These Terms do contain a limitation of our liability. If you
            do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use our website, bot, or other Services.
        </p>

        <h5 class="card-subtitle">Changes to these Terms</h5>
        <p class="card-text" style="color: white">
            We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Unless explicitly stated, any new features
            which are added to the Service shall also be subject to the Terms. Whenever we make changes to
            these Terms, the changes are effective 30 days after we post such revised Terms (indicated by
            revising the date at the top of these Terms). It is your responsibility to check Tornium for
            changes to these Terms. If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into
            effect, then you have accepted the changes to these Terms.
        </p>

        <h5 class="card-subtitle">Privacy Policy</h5>
        <p class="card-text" style="color: white">
            For information about how we collect and use information about users of the Service and API key
            usage, please check out our privacy policy available <a href="/privacy">here</a>.

            do not own or control. Your use of the Service may also include the use of applications that
            are developed or owned by a third party. Your use of such third party applications, websites,
            and services is governed by that party's own terms of service or privacy policies. We encourage
            you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of any third party application, website,
            or service that you visit or use.

        <h5 class="card-subtitle">Features and Bugs</h5>
        <p class="card-text" style="color: white">
            We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.
        </p>

        <p class="card-text" style="color: white">
            We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don’t guarantee completely error-free Services.
        </p>

        <p class="card-text" style="color: white">
            You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Service, including but 
            not limited to ideas about improving the Service or products. By submitting any idea, you irrevocably
            assign to us all of your right, title and interest in and to your feedback, comments and suggestions.
        </p>

        <h5 class="card-subtitle">Services Adaptations and API Terms</h5>
        <p class="card-text" style="color: white">
            We offer Application Program Interfaces (“API”s) for some of our Services. Any use of the API, including through a third-party product that accesses the Services, is bound by these Terms plus the following specific terms:
            <ul>
                <li>You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.</li>
                <li>You may be required to obtain an API key or other credentials to use the API. You are responsible for maintaining the security of these credentials and for all activities that occur using them.</li>
                <li>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account. We, at our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. If we need to suspend your account, we will attempt to warn the account owner first. If your API usage could or has caused downtime, we may cut off access without prior notice.</li>
                <li>We reserve the right to modify or discontinue API access at any time, with or without notice. Continued use of the API following changes constitutes acceptance of those changes.</li>
            </ul>

            Some third-party providers may have created integrations between our Services and theirs. We are not liable or accountable for any of these third-party integrations.
