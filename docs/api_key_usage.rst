API Key Usage
=============
Tornium uses user-provided API keys to connect with Torn and retrieve necessary data for its features. Tornium uses this access to your in-game data to retrieve information necessary for functionality enabled by you (or others in the case of factions and Discord servers). By default, Tornium will only retrieve certain data such as basic user data to keep the database up-to-date and to retrieve attacks for the stat database. Certain faction-related data may be retrieved with your API key if you are an AA member of your faction and certain features have been set up by your faction (or by the admins of your faction's Discord server). Furthermore data may be retrieved with your API key if you are an admin of a Discord server depending on the server's configuration.
