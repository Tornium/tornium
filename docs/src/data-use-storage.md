## API Keys
We persistently store Torn API keys to retrieve data from Torn regarding your user and potentially your faction, company, and other data depending on features enabled and permissions granted to you in-game. Your API key(s) will only be used for features regarding your account, regarding your faction if you have the API Access permission, regarding any Discord servers in which you are an admin. No other user will be able to see your API key(s).

## User Attacks
We collect user attacks to calculate the stat scores of the opponent for the stat database. This data (except for related data in the stat database) is not stored persistently. Your attacks cannot be accessed by anyone.

## User Battle Stats
We collect the battle stats of users who are signed into Tornium and potentially their faction members through <a href="https://www.tornstats.com">TornStats</a> to calculate stat scores from attacks and to calculate estimated respect for the chain list generator and stat database. All users' battle stats are NOT shared publicly with anyone nor do we view them. This data is stored persistently.

## User CPR
We collect the Organized Crime 2.0 success chance of users with the "API Access" permission for each OC position for each OC type if the user's faction has migrated to Organized Crimes 2.0. This data can be accessed by your faction's members with the "Manage Organized Crimes" permission. This feature for your account can be disabled in Tornium's <a href="/settings">user settings</a>.
