# Overdose
Tornium's overdose notifications allow factions to have messages sent to Discord when faction members overdose.

## Overdose Configuration
Under the `Faction Overdose` section of the faction's linked Discord server, the faction's overdose channel and overdose policy can be configured. The overdose channel is the location overdose notifications will be sent to. The overdose policy controls how notification will be sent to the overdose channel. If the overdose policy is set to daily, all overdoses not previously notified up to 24 hours earlier will be sent in one message. If the overdose policy is set to immediate, overdoses notifications will be sent as the overdose is first registered to the database.
