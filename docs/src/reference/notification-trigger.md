# Notification Triggers
Notification triggers (aka triggers) provide the underlying logic for [notifications](notification.md) through [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) code and [Liquid](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/) templates.

At this time, only official notification triggers can be used. Once notifications and the underlying architecture is stable, the creation of custom notification triggers will be enabled.
