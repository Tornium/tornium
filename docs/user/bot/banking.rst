Faction Banking
===============
Members can send vault requests via Tornium to validate the requests and notify faction bankers.

Banking Options
---------------
As a slash command, faction banking can be run from any channel in a faction's Discord server or from the Tornium website. Vault requests will be forwarded to a specific channel and with an optional ping to faction banker role(s).

.. note::
    Currently, withdrawal requests can only be run in servers or via the website.

Banking Channel
```````````````
Banking requests will be forwarded to this channel when a vault request is sent. If the channel is marked as "Disabled", vault requests will not be allowed.

Banker Roles
````````````
Banking requests will ping the selected roles upon vault request messages, but banker roles are not required.

Banking Slash Commands
----------------------
Only the ``/balance`` command can be run in DMs; everything else can only be run in the faction's server.

Balance
```````
.. code-block::

    /balance [member]

Returns the member's vault balance of money and points in their current faction.

If the command is run in a Discord server and the invoker has API access in the faction, a member can be mentioned to obtain their vault balance.

Withdraw
````````
.. code-block::

    /withdraw (amount) [option]

Sends a vault request to the banking channel and mentions the banker roles if banking is enabled by the faction.

A vault request will be marked as cancelled if it is not fulfilled within one hour of the request. If a vault request is marked as fulfilled but no log of this is found in the faction logs within ten minutes of being marked as fulfilled, the request will be marked as cancelled.

The ``amount`` parameter allows for the suffixes used by Torn to shorten money amounts. Additionally ``all`` can be used to request all of the member's vault balance.
