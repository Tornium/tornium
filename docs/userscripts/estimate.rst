Estimate Userscript
===================
The estimation userscript is a free alternative to other services (such as BSP and TSC) pulling data from Tornium to show user stats on Torn directly.

.. warning::
   This userscript is in active development, so the userscript's features listed here may change in the near future. This documentation was last updated for v0.3.8-3.

Installation Instruction
------------------------
This userscript is currently tested on Firefox and Chrome using `ViolentMonkey <https://violentmonkey.github.io/>`_ and `TamperMonkey <https://www.tampermonkey.net/>`_ as well as `TornPDA <https://github.com/Manuito83/torn-pda>`_.

#. If you don't have one already, install a userscript manager on your browser. This does not apply to users on TornDPA.
#. Navigate to the `userscript <https://github.com/Tornium/tornium/blob/master/userscripts/tornium-estimate.user.js>`_ and press the raw button (or visit `this <https://github.com/Tornium/tornium/raw/refs/heads/master/userscripts/tornium-estimate.user.js>`_ which should automatically prompt you to install the userscript). If your userscript manager is installed properly, this will automatically install the userscript and show a confirmation page from the userscript manager. If you're installing the userscript onto TornPDA, make sure that the injection time is set to the end.
#. Visit a `user profile <https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=2383326>`_ on Torn which will show a button under the username to authenticate the userscript. Pressing the button will send you to Tornium's OAuth portal if you're already signed in. If you're not already signed in, you can sign in with the Discord sign-in (so you don't need to provide an API key) or with a `limited access API key <https://www.torn.com/preferences.php#tab=api?&step=addNewKey&title=Tornium&type=3>`_. Once signed in, you can authorize the application to do perform actions against your Tornium account, and you'll be redirected back to Torn (eventually).
#. Now you can visit any page the userscript supports to see stats according to Tornium.

.. note ::
   Due to security with how userscripts work, to help prevent malicious use of data, you will be forced to re-authourize the userscript once a week.

How It Works
------------
Depending on the page, the userscript will make an API call to Tornium's servers to retrieve an estimate of the user's stats or to retrieve the users stats from its database. An uncapped fair fight score will also be generated from your stats the last time you've visited the gym page (otherwise the fair fight score will not load in any location). Being uncapped, this allows you to quickly see the relative strength of the target with 3x FF being about 50-75% of your stats.

.. note ::
   Tornium's estimation userscript does not require you to sign into Tornium with an API key, but some user data (and therefore estimates) may not be up-to-date without using an API key to update the user's data.

.. note ::
   If you have a fair fight value of "GYM", you'll need to visit the Gym page in-game for the userscript to update its local-only copy of your stats to calculate the fair fight.

Supported Pages
---------------
#. User profile: shows exact estimate and value from stat database with FFs
#. Attack loader: shows shortened estimated stats with FF
#. Advanced search: shows the fair fight based on estimated stats for shown users
