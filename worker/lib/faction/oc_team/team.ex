  Assign organized crimes to organized crime teams.

  Organized crime teams that have completed their OC (or have an expired OC) or are recently created and don't have an 
  assigned OC will be assigned a new organized crime. If there is an available OC of the correct OC name, the OC team 
  will be assigned to that OC. If there does not exist such an OC, the `{:spawn_required, oc_name}` will be returned
  for the OC team to indicate that an OC manager will need to spawn an OC of that name.

  It is assumed that the provided OC teams are already filtered to not include teams of completed OCs, teams of
  expired OCs, and new OC teams. While assigning OCs to teams, priority will be given to an OC partially filled with
  exclusively members of a team.
